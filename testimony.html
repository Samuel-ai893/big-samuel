                <h2>Testimonies of Faith</h2>
                    <p> 1) Testimony of Deliverance from Kidnapper (Gbomogbomo) 
                        Bro. Joshua, 
                        Lagos. 
                        Friday, 30th January 2026. <br>
                        
                        Dear Pastor,  
                        I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus. I am testifying to the power and anointing in the Second Coming of Christ Ministry.  
                        My friend and I went out to get fuel (he is a pastor's son from another church). On the road, someone stopped us and said, "Follow me." 
                        Immediately, my friend started going. Then I spoke and said, "Is this a prank or a joke? Where are we going?" The man was shocked and said, "So you can talk? 
                        I'm sorry!" Before I could realize what was happening, my friend had already gone far. I quickly caught up with him, tapped him, and called his name. 
                        He then realized where he was. Praise the Lord!  

                        Thank you, Jesus, for not allowing the power of darkness to overcome me and for not allowing the devil to kidnap me. Hallelujah!  

                        Yours in Christ, son of God. 
                    </p>

                        Sister. Wunmi Olapade,
                        London. 
                        Saturday, 16th February 2026. <br>
                        
                        Dear Pastor & Spiritual Father,

                        Calvary greetings to you and the ministry in Jesus' name. 
                        My mother-in-law had a dream that I carried my child (Zion) on my lap. 
                        Then, a strange person put a black substance in his mouth. 
                        She shouted at the person and wanted to remove the substance from Zion’s mouth, but she couldn’t. 
                        Then she woke up. She called the pastor and narrated the dream. 
                        The pastor blessed red oil for us and asked that we give Zion some to lick. We did as instructed. 
                        The following day, she had another dream that she saw Zion vomiting a black substance.

                        Praise the Lord, Church!! Thank you, Father, thank you, Son, thank you, Holy Spirit.
                    </p>

                        Sister. Yemi,
                        USA. 
                        Saturday, 17th January 2026. <br>
                        
                        Calvary greetings, sir. 

                         Sometime last year, around Christmas time, I forgot my bag in the Uber I entered.  
                         The driver went and dropped it at the police station in another state. All my paper were in that bag: 
                         my key drive, ID, and work authorization. I had to sleep outside for two days. 
                         I called on the God of Second Coming, and His wrath went out for me to rebuke Satan. I want to thank you, 
                         LORD, for my bag being returned to me within two weeks by the police. Nothing was missing and nothing was broken
                         praise the Lord. Hallelujah!
                    </p>
                    <p> 4) Testimony of Success 
                        Pastor. Uduak,
                        USA.
                        Saturday, 22nd June 2024.<br>
                        
                        Dear Pastor,

                        I had my prostate surgery on Wednesday, 18th June 2024. 
                        I didn't fart, which gave me concern and prevented me from being discharged. 
                        I called on the Holy Spirit, and God intervened in four ways: <br> 
                        1) Through gastrointestinal anointings, <br> 
                        2) Through the operation of the Holy Spirit, <br> 
                        3) Through the blessings of the water of healing, and <br> 
                        4) By tearing up the letter that the devil had written. <br>

                        On Saturday morning, after three days, I farted and excreted.
                        
                        This means my intestines have started functioning well. 
                        The body systems will now receive healing. This implies that the operation was successful. 
                        Certainly, God will complete my healing in Jesus name.

                        Thanks for your prayers!
                    .<br><br>
