                <h2> Testimonies of Hope</h2>
                    <p> 1) Testimony of Healings of Fever
                        Sister Ibukun. 
                        Ogbomoso. 
                        Wed, 22nd January 2025. <br>
                        
                        Praise be unto the Lord, 
                        For about a couple of weeks, I have been battling with malaria and had taken severe pills in order to be relieved. But, It was getting worse.
                        So I called  Pastor on the phone, and he prayed for me, and after an hour, I couldn't feel pain anymore. God had healed me.
                        Glory glory to Almighty GOD.
                        The Church of God should help me to shout 7 big hallelujahs for the perfection of my health. Hallelujah.
                    </p>
                    <p> 2) Healings of nosebleed/ epistaxis & Malaria.
                        Bro. Seyi,
                        Lagos. 
                        Tue, 21st January 2024. <br>
                        
                        Calvary Greetings,
                        I am writing this letter to testify to Gods healing upon my life. 
                        I woke up on monday morning bleeding heavily from my nose, and i called the pastor to pray for me.
                        He instructed me to look for white handkerchief or cotton wool and put rubb on it that i should put it in my nose and inhale it, that it will stop.
                        A few minutes later, the bleeding stopped. Though, I had collected injections that didn't stop the bleeding.
                        
                        Malaria Healed.
                        I had Malaria again. 
                        I asked him to pray for me for God to heal me from malaria and he did. 
                        Pastor asked me to get a bottle of water and he prayed on it and asked me to take it. Since then my healing process has been smooth.
                        Children of God should help me shout hallelujah to appreciate God on my behalf.
                    </p>
                    <p> 3) Testimony of Deliverance 
                        From the spirit of Madness 
                        Sis Elizabeth,
                        Lagos.
                        Mon, 20th January 2025.<br>
                        
                        Dear Pastor,
                        Calvary greetings to you and the entire members of this powerful ministry.
                        I want to thank God of this commission for  his deep love and concern  over my life. 
                        It all started like a minor thing last year. 
                        I noticed I kept forgetting things easily .
                        On the 7th of January this year, at times while walking on the road, I will hear a voice within me telling me to take off my clothes. 
                        This voice was so compelling, but for the grace of God, i was resisting it.
                        But after some time, I almost took them off on the road.
                        It happened again the second day. As I got to the gate of my house, I rushed into the compound and took off my clothes while climbing upstairs.
                        Then, I sought the face of the Holy Spirit through our father in the Lord. 
                        The Holy Spirit said they had already sent the spirit of madness to me and just waiting for it's manifestation. 
                        Without having to fast nor involve myself in extensive spiritual exercise & prayers, a simple solution from the Holy Spirit was proffered. 
                        Holy Spirit said I should just stay indoors for three days!On the first day of my being indoors, he prayed and anointed oil through phone calls, instructing me to pour it over my head  saying I will not run mad. 
                        On the third and final day, the Holy Spirit prayed again over the phone and anointed oil, which I poured from my head down and bathed immediately & I was relieved. 
                        A few days latter, after coming out, I started feeling my head expanding as if it wanted to burst. The pain was so excruciating that I had to call on pastor again.
                        He said I should just claim the work rhe  Holy Spirit had done.
                        That it was just a sign to truly show me that they had in the spiritual realm made me mad and only waiting for the physical manifestation.
                        After going through all those attacks, now I am ok. Praise God. Halleluyah. 
                        I praise and thank the God of SCCM for delivering me from insanity and putting the enemies to shame.
                        Glory  be to God of SCCM.  
                        God bless  you, sir. 
                        Your anointing will never get dry in Jesus' mighty name.
                        Agba yin o ni di agbaya, e dagba, e dogbo. Oke ti e ti wa, e ni suubu oo. Iwaju le o ma lo, e ni pada seyin o. God bless you, sir.
                        May God continue to use you for us. You will never fall. Thank you, sir.
                        Pls let the church help me to sing this song to praise my God. 
                        Thank you Lord..thank you Lord.. all I have to say is thank you, Lord.<br><br>
