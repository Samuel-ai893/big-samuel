                <h2>**Testimonies of Faith**</h2>
                    <p> 1) Testimony of Deliverance from Kidnapper (Gbomogbomo) 
                        Bro. Joshua. 
                        Lagos. 
                        Friday, 30th January 2026. <br>
                        
                        Dear Pastor,  
                        I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus. I am testifying to the power and anointing in the Second Coming of Christ Ministry.  
                        My friend and I went out to get fuel (he is a pastor's son from another church). On the road, someone stopped us and said, "Follow me." Immediately, my friend started going. Then I spoke and said, "Is this a prank or a joke? Where are we going?" The man was shocked and said, "So you can talk? I'm sorry!" Before I could realize what was happening, my friend had already gone far. I quickly caught up with him, tapped him, and called his name. He then realized where he was. Praise the Lord!  

                        Thank you, Jesus, for not allowing the power of darkness to overcome me and for not allowing the devil to kidnap me. Hallelujah!  

                        Yours in Christ, son of God. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 2) Testimony of Deliverance.
                        Sister Wunmi Olapade,
                        USA. 
                        Saturday, 16th February 2026. <br>
                        
                        Dear Pastor & Spiritual Father,

                        Calvary greetings to you and the ministry in Jesus' name. 
                        My mother-in-law had a dream that I carried my child (Zion) on my lap. 
                        Then, a strange person put a black substance in his mouth. 
                        She shouted at the person and wanted to remove the substance from Zion’s mouth, but she couldn’t. 
                        Then she woke up. She called the pastor and narrated the dream. 
                        The pastor blessed red oil for us and asked that we give Zion some to lick. We did as instructed. 
                        The following day, she had another dream that she saw Zion vomiting a black substance.

                        Praise the Lord, Church!! Thank you, Father, thank you, Son, thank you, Holy Spirit.
                    </p>
                    <p> 3) Testimony of Deliverance 
                        From the spirit of Madness 
                        Sis Elizabeth,
                        Lagos.
                        Mon, 20th January 2025.<br>
                        
                        Dear Pastor,
                        Calvary greetings to you and the entire members of this powerful ministry.
                        I want to thank God of this commission for  his deep love and concern  over my life. 
                        It all started like a minor thing last year. 
                        I noticed I kept forgetting things easily .
                        On the 7th of January this year, at times while walking on the road, I will hear a voice within me telling me to take off my clothes. 
                        This voice was so compelling, but for the grace of God, i was resisting it.
                        But after some time, I almost took them off on the road.
                        It happened again the second day. As I got to the gate of my house, I rushed into the compound and took off my clothes while climbing upstairs.
                        Then, I sought the face of the Holy Spirit through our father in the Lord. 
                        The Holy Spirit said they had already sent the spirit of madness to me and just waiting for it's manifestation. 
                        Without having to fast nor involve myself in extensive spiritual exercise & prayers, a simple solution from the Holy Spirit was proffered. 
                        Holy Spirit said I should just stay indoors for three days!On the first day of my being indoors, he prayed and anointed oil through phone calls, instructing me to pour it over my head  saying I will not run mad. 
                        On the third and final day, the Holy Spirit prayed again over the phone and anointed oil, which I poured from my head down and bathed immediately & I was relieved. 
                        A few days latter, after coming out, I started feeling my head expanding as if it wanted to burst. The pain was so excruciating that I had to call on pastor again.
                        He said I should just claim the work rhe  Holy Spirit had done.
                        That it was just a sign to truly show me that they had in the spiritual realm made me mad and only waiting for the physical manifestation.
                        After going through all those attacks, now I am ok. Praise God. Halleluyah. 
                        I praise and thank the God of SCCM for delivering me from insanity and putting the enemies to shame.
                        Glory  be to God of SCCM.  
                        God bless  you, sir. 
                        Your anointing will never get dry in Jesus' mighty name.
                        Agba yin o ni di agbaya, e dagba, e dogbo. Oke ti e ti wa, e ni suubu oo. Iwaju le o ma lo, e ni pada seyin o. God bless you, sir.
                        May God continue to use you for us. You will never fall. Thank you, sir.
                        Pls let the church help me to sing this song to praise my God. 
                        Thank you Lord..thank you Lord.. all I have to say is thank you, Lord.<br><br>
