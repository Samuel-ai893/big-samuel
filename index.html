                <h2>Believe in Jesus Christ for the sake of His works... </h2>
                    <p> "It is written in the Bible that Jesus Christ said, "And when he had called the people [unto him] with his disciples also, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 
                        The things of the Spirit are like this: they will take you down, it will bring you to the mountain and it will take you to the depths of the river but it will bring you out again. 
                        All those things He is doing for you are to wash you clean for the work He is going to give you. Our church is very young, 
                        considering that it started in January, 2024, where we began to see all the goodness that God Almighty has promised us over the years applied in our lives.<br>
                        Revelation 22:12 (KJV) And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.
